    <h1>The Best Movie According to Siddarth</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time.</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>1.Ballad of Narayama </h3>
    <pre>
        “The Ballad of Narayama” is a Japanese film of great beauty and elegant artifice,
        telling a story of startling cruelty. What a space it opens up between its origins in the kabuki style and its subject
        of starvation in a mountain village!
        The village enforces a tradition of carrying those who have reached the age of 70 up the side of mountain and abandoning
        them there to die of exposure.
        
        Keisuke Kinoshita‘s 1958 film tells its story with deliberate artifice, using an elaborate set with a path beside a
        bubbling brook, matte paintings for the backgrounds,
        mist on dewey evenings, and lighting that drops the backgrounds to black at dramatic moments and then brings up
        realistic lighting again. Some of its exteriors use black foregrounds and bloody red skies;
        others use grays and blues. As in kabuki theater, there is a black-clad narrator to tell us what’s happening.

    <h3>2.Monsieur Hire</h3>
    <pre>
            Patrice Leconte‘s “Monsieur Hire” is a tragedy about 
            loneliness and erotomania, told about two solitary people 
            who have nothing else in common. It involves a murder, and 
            the opening shot is of a corpse. Monsieur Hire is a scrawny, 
            balding middle-aged tailor who lives by himself. Alice is a beautiful,
            tender-hearted 22-year-old blonde who lives alone across
            the courtyard from Hire in the same apartment building.

    <h3>3.“There are such devils”</h3>
    <pre>
            Sean Penn‘s “The Pledge” begins when it seems his protagonist’s career is ending. 
            Jack Nicholson plays Jerry Black, a Nevada police detective whose retirement party 
            is interrupted by news of the brutal murder of a young girl. 
            Across the noisy room he senses a shift in tone, and joins a conversation between his chief and 
            the man who will be taking over his job. 
            Then he goes along to the murder scene, perhaps out of habit or because he hasn’t officially retired. 
            The little girl in a red coat is a pitiful sight with her blood staining the snow.
